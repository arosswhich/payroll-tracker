# payroll-tracker

## Description

My motivation for this project was to create a web page that could take in user data and create an array of information about employees that included their first name, last name, and salary. Then with the input users provided it would output the average salary of the employees and select a random employee from the array. These would be logged to the console as well as displaying upon the screen for users to see. This means that employers who needed to find the average salary of their employees would be able to find out without doing the math themself or pulling out a calculator.

## Usage

Upon opening the page there is a blank employee roster with an area for first names, last names, and salaries of each employee. In order to add to this roster users must press the add employees button. Then they will be prompted to enter the employee's first name. Once the first name is entered they must then press the ok button to add it to the array. They will then be prompted to enter the employee's last name and pressing ok again will add it. Then they will be prompted to enter the employee's salary and after doing so and pressing ok it will ask them if they would like to add another employee. If ok is pressed the process will repeat and they can input more information, but if cancel is pressed it will display the average salary and a random employee. Users can decide how many employees they would like to add to the roster.
